An email shall be treated as spam when it comes from a mail domain (smtp sender) that is classified as spamming, or it contains a set of terms that are referrable to spam. The training phase shall deliver a model of spam that is compatible with the above specifications. \n",

    "Overall, students shall deliver the solution via GitHub. On accessing the solution we value it by anti-cheating technologies, and therefore it will not be considered acceptable when more than 60% of the code is not original. Along with the solution, please upload also the confusion matrix and some analysis on the effectiveness. No value shall be given to solution strength. If a solution is not at the state-of-the-art, we consider it fine in any case, provided it comes along with the above characteristics."
